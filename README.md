## Innovation

- The player can double jump.
- All animations are loaded from a TMX file. 
- When double jumping, the player leaves particles behind him.
- There's a transition when the player dies and changes of level.
- Colliders are made of objectgroups instead of tiles.
- Checkpoints added
- Game can be paused
- Hitting the arrow keys transitions to previous commands.
