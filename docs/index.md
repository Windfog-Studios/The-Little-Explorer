# The Little Explorer

## Introduction
The Little Explorer is a platformer game developed by Marc Pagès and Silvino Medina. We both are students in CITM, a university located in Terrassa, Catalonia, Spain. 
This project is made for the Game Development class in which students learn the basics for programming a video game from almost scratch.
